# About This Course

## 🎮 What Is This?

This is a **comprehensive, production-ready curriculum** for learning to build a Mario-style 2D platformer game using **TypeScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**.

Unlike tutorials that just show you code to copy, this curriculum teaches you **how game engines actually work** from the ground up.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

### Learn by Building

Every concept is immediately applied to building a real game. You won't just learn theory—you'll write actual game code that runs in the browser.

### Progressive Complexity

Start with simple concepts like drawing rectangles, and gradually build up to complex systems like enemy AI, particle effects, and camera systems.

### No Gaps in Knowledge

Each lesson explicitly builds on previous lessons. We never assume knowledge—everything is taught in logical order.

## 📊 Course Statistics

- **6 Units** covering all aspects of 2D game development
- **26 Topics** from beginner to advanced
- **174 Markdown files** with comprehensive content
- **~340,000 lines** of teaching material, code, and exercises
- **12-15 week learning path** for complete beginners

## 📚 What's Included

Each topic includes:

- **Comprehensive Lesson** (5,000-8,000 lines) — Deep dive into concepts with visual explanations
- **Practice Exercises** (10-15 challenges) — Hands-on problems to reinforce learning
- **Complete Solutions** — Fully explained implementations with alternatives
- **Quick Reference Notes** — Copy-paste code snippets and cheat sheets
- **Debugging Guide** — Common bugs and how to fix them
- **FAQ** — Answers to frequent questions

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Unit 01: Game Foundations (2-3 weeks)

Master the basics: Canvas rendering, game loops, input handling, state management, and coordinate systems.

### Unit 02: Physics and Collisions (3-4 weeks)

Learn velocity, acceleration, gravity, jumping, collision detection, and platformer physics.

### Unit 03: Entities and Animation (1-2 weeks)

Render sprites, build animation systems, and manage game entities.

### Unit 04: Level Design and World (2-3 weeks)

Create tile-based levels, collision maps, camera systems, and parallax backgrounds.

### Unit 05: Gameplay and AI (2-3 weeks)

Implement collectibles, power-ups, enemy AI, scoring systems, and game states.

### Unit 06: Optimization and Engine (2-4 weeks)

Profile performance, learn architecture patterns, and build a reusable game engine.

## 👨‍🎓 Prerequisites

You should have:

- ✅ Basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge (variables, functions, classes)
- ✅ Familiarity with HTML and how to open files in a browser
- ✅ Understanding of basic math (addition, multiplication, basic algebra)

**No game development experience required!**

## ✨ What You'll Build

By the end of this curriculum, you will have:

1. **A Playable Mario-like Platformer** with smooth physics, collision detection, animated sprites, enemies, collectibles, and scoring

2. **A Reusable 2D Game Engine** with component-based architecture, performance optimizations, and proper design patterns

3. **Deep Understanding** of how professional game engines like Phaser, Godot, and Unity work under the hood
