## üí° Learning Tips

### 1. **Code Along**
Don't just read ‚Äî type every example yourself. Muscle memory matters!

### 2. **Experiment Freely**
Modify values, break things, see what happens. Debugging teaches you more than perfect code.

### 3. **Build Small, Build Often**
Create a working prototype at the end of every topic, even if it's rough.

### 4. **Visualize Your Bugs**
Draw hitboxes, velocity vectors, and collision points on screen when debugging.

### 5. **Take Breaks**
Game development is complex. Step away when stuck ‚Äî solutions often come during breaks.

### 6. **Join Communities**
Share your progress on Twitter, Reddit's r/gamedev, or Discord servers. Feedback accelerates learning.

### 7. **Version Control**
Commit your code after each topic. You'll thank yourself later.

### 8. **Profile Early**
Use browser DevTools to measure FPS and memory from the start. Prevention beats optimization.
