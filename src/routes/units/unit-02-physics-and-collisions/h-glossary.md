# Unit 02 - Glossary

## A
**AABB** - Axis-Aligned Bounding Box. Rectangle collision shape aligned with screen axes.

**Acceleration** - Rate of change of velocity. Measured in pixels/second².

## B
**Bounding Box** - Rectangle that surrounds an object for collision detection.

## C
**Collision Detection** - Checking if two objects overlap.

**Collision Response** - What happens after collision (bounce, stop, etc).

**Coyote Time** - Grace period where player can jump after leaving ledge.

## D
**Dash** - Quick burst of speed in one direction.

**Delta Time (dt)** - Time elapsed since last frame. Used for frame-independent movement.

## F
**Frame Independent** - Movement that works same speed regardless of framerate.

## G
**Gravity** - Constant downward acceleration. Typically 980-1500 px/s².

**Ground Pound** - Move where player slams downward quickly.

## J
**Juice** - Visual/audio feedback that makes game feel responsive.

**Jump Buffer** - Grace period where jump input is remembered.

## L
**Ledge Grab** - Grabbing onto edge of platform to climb up.

## O
**Object Pooling** - Reusing objects instead of creating/destroying for performance.

## P
**Particle System** - Manager for visual effect particles.

**Platformer** - Game genre where player jumps between platforms.

## S
**Screen Shake** - Camera shake for impact feeling.

**Separating Axis Theorem** - Advanced collision detection method.

## T
**Terminal Velocity** - Maximum falling speed.

**Tilemap** - Grid-based level layout using tile images.

**Tile Coordinates** - Position in tile grid (col, row).

## V
**Velocity** - Speed and direction. Measured in pixels/second.

## W
**Wall Jump** - Jumping off a wall while sliding down it.

**Wall Slide** - Slowing down while touching wall.

**World Coordinates** - Absolute pixel position in game world.
