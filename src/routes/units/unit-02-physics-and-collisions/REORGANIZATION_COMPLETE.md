# Unit 02 - Reorganization Complete! ‚úÖ

## Summary

Unit 02 has been successfully reorganized to eliminate duplicate content and establish proper learning progression. The unit now contains **7 unique topics** that build logically from basic physics to complete platformer mechanics.

---

## What Changed

### ‚ùå **Removed**
- **Old Topic 06**: `06-velocity-and-acceleration/` (duplicate of Topic 01)
- The old Topic 07 folder name `07-gravity-and-jumping/` (misnamed)

### ‚úÖ **Added**
- **New Topic 05**: `05-advanced-movement/` (wall jump, dash, ground pound, ledge grab)
- **New Topic 06**: `06-particle-systems/` (visual effects, juice, screen shake)

### üîÑ **Renamed**
- **Topic 07**: `07-gravity-and-jumping/` ‚Üí `07-tilemaps-and-level-design/` (corrected name to match actual content)

## Learning Progression

The 7 topics now follow a clear, logical progression:

```
01. Velocity/Acceleration  ‚Üí  Learn basic physics
02. Gravity/Jumping        ‚Üí  Add vertical movement
03. Collision Detection    ‚Üí  Prevent passing through objects
04. Platformer Physics     ‚Üí  Combine into working platformer
05. Advanced Movement      ‚Üí  Add depth with special moves
06. Particle Systems       ‚Üí  Polish with visual feedback
07. Tilemaps              ‚Üí  Build complete tile-based worlds
```

Each topic builds naturally on the previous one, with no duplicates or gaps.

## File Statistics

### Per-Topic Files (42 files total)
- **Topic 01-07**: 6 files each √ó 7 topics = 42 files
  - `a-lesson.md` - Comprehensive teaching
  - `b-exercises.md` - 10 practice challenges
  - `c-solutions.md` - Complete working solutions
  - `d-notes.md` - Quick reference cheat sheet
  - `i-debugging.md` - Common bugs & fixes
  - `j-faq.md` - Frequently asked questions

### Unit-Level Files (3 files)
- `e-resources.md` - External documentation, tools, videos
- `f-self-study.md` - 4-week study plan
- `h-glossary.md` - Game development terminology

### Total: 45 files ‚úÖ

---

## Duration Update

**Old**: 2-3 weeks (4 topics)  
**New**: 3-4 weeks (7 topics)

The extended duration reflects the expanded scope:
- Basic platformer ‚Üí Complete advanced platformer
- Just physics ‚Üí Physics + visual polish + level design
- Minimal features ‚Üí Production-ready movement system

---

## Student Outcomes

By completing the revised Unit 02, students will:

‚úÖ **Understand** core physics concepts (velocity, acceleration, gravity)  
‚úÖ **Implement** collision detection and response  
‚úÖ **Create** a basic platformer controller  
‚úÖ **Master** advanced movement mechanics (wall jump, dash, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Add** professional visual effects (particles, shake)  
‚úÖ **Build** tile-based levels with proper collision  
‚úÖ **Apply** object pooling for performance

**Result**: Students leave Unit 02 with a complete, polished platformer instead of just basic physics.
