## üîç Lesson Continuity Analysis

### Methodology
Reviewed lessons across all units to verify:
1. Prerequisite clarity
2. Backward references to prior topics
3. Progressive difficulty
4. Knowledge gap prevention
5. Novice accessibility

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ Excellent Continuity Features Found:

1. **Explicit "Building on Previous Units" Sections**
   - Found in Unit 02-06 lessons
   - Example from Unit 02-01:
     ```markdown
     ## Building on Unit 01: The Foundation You Already Have
     
     ### From Unit 01-02: Delta Time (‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL!)
     Remember **delta time** from the game loop lesson?
     ```

2. **Specific Lesson References**
   - Lessons cite specific prior topics (e.g., "Unit 01-02", "Topic 03")
   - Clear prerequisite lists at start of each lesson
   - Forward scaffolding with "Next Steps" sections

3. **Before/After Code Comparisons**
   - Shows transformation from previous knowledge to new concepts
   - Example from Unit 03-01:
     ```markdown
     **Before (Unit 01-02):**
     // Drew colored rectangle
     ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, 32, 48);
     
     **After (This Lesson):**
     // Draw actual sprite!
     ctx.drawImage(spriteSheet, ...);
     ```

4. **Progressive Skill Building**
   - Unit 01: Static rendering, timing, input, coordinates
   - Unit 02: Add motion and physics
   - Unit 03: Add visual polish with sprites/animation  
   - Unit 04: Build large worlds with levels
   - Unit 05: Add gameplay mechanics
   - Unit 06: Optimize and create reusable engine

5. **Visual Learning Aids**
   - ASCII diagrams throughout
   - Coordinate system visualizations
   - State machine diagrams
   - Dependency charts

6. **Frequent Critical Reminders**
   - Delta time emphasized throughout Unit 02+
   - Coordinate conversion formulas repeated
   - Physics concepts reinforced

#### ‚ùå Gaps Found: **NONE**

After thorough analysis:
- ‚úÖ No missing prerequisite knowledge
- ‚úÖ No sudden difficulty spikes
- ‚úÖ No assumed knowledge beyond stated prerequisites
- ‚úÖ No dangling references to non-existent lessons
- ‚úÖ No orphan topics without context

### Difficulty Progression:

```
Unit 01: ‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  (1/10) - Beginner
Unit 02: ‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  (4/10) - Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate
