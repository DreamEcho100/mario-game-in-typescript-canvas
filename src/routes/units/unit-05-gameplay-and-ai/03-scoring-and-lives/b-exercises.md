## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic scoring working before adding combos
2. **Test Thoroughly:** Make sure score never goes negative or NaN
3. **Visual Feedback:** Players should always know why they got points
4. **Balance Carefully:** Point values should reward skill appropriately
5. **Cache Strings:** Don't format score text every frame
6. **Use Events:** Decouple scoring from game logic
7. **Handle Errors:** localStorage can fail, always have fallbacks
8. **Pool Objects:** Reuse popups instead of creating new ones
