## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic state switching working first
2. **Test Transitions:** Try every possible state transition
3. **Handle Edge Cases:** What if player pauses during fade?
4. **Use Enums:** Define state names as constants
5. **Separate Concerns:** Each state should be independent
6. **Lifecycle Important:** Always call enter/exit properly
7. **Save Often:** Test save/load frequently
8. **Input Management:** Clear input between states
