## Study Tips

**Effective Learning:**
1. Read lesson first (don't jump to code)
2. Understand theory before implementing
3. Complete exercises in order
4. Check solutions only after trying
5. Debug yourself before asking for help

**Practice Schedule:**
- 2-3 hours per day
- 30 min review each week
- 1 project per week
- Test yourself regularly

**When Stuck:**
1. Check debugging guide
2. Read FAQ
3. Review lesson code
4. Google specific error
5. Ask in community
