# Topic 04: Scrolling and Parallax - Exercises

Complete these exercises to master parallax scrolling.

---

## Exercise 1: Basic Parallax Layer
Create a single parallax layer that scrolls at 0.5x camera speed.

**Requirements:**
- Load background image
- Calculate parallax offset
- Render at correct position

---

## Exercise 2: Multi-Layer Parallax
Create 3 layers with different parallax ratios.

**Requirements:**
- Far layer: 0.2x speed
- Mid layer: 0.5x speed
- Near layer: 0.8x speed
- Render in correct order

---

## Exercise 3: Repeating Background
Make a background tile infinitely.

**Requirements:**
- Seamless horizontal tiling
- No gaps or overlaps
- Handle any camera position

---

## Exercise 4: Vertical Parallax
Add Y-axis parallax for vertical levels.

**Requirements:**
- Parallax on both X and Y axes
- Tile in both directions
- Test with vertical scrolling

---

## Exercise 5: Auto-Scrolling Clouds
Create clouds that scroll automatically.

**Requirements:**
- Auto-scroll at 20px/second
- Independent of camera
- Wrap seamlessly

---

## Exercise 6: Sky Gradient
Create a dynamic sky background.

**Requirements:**
- Top-to-bottom gradient
- Change colors over time
- Render before parallax layers

---

## Exercise 7: Atmospheric Fog
Add a semi-transparent fog layer.

**Requirements:**
- 50% opacity
- Slow auto-scroll
- Render over other layers

---

## Exercise 8: Complete Mario Parallax
Combine all features into one system.

**Requirements:**
- Sky gradient
- Multiple parallax layers
- Clouds
- Fog
- 60 FPS performance

---

## Exercise 9: Performance Optimization
Optimize parallax rendering.

**Requirements:**
- Cache layers off-screen
- Cull invisible layers
- Measure FPS improvement

---

## Exercise 10: Day/Night Cycle
Change sky colors based on time.

**Requirements:**
- Transition between day/night
- Smooth color interpolation
- Affect all layers
