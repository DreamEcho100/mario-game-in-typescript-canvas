# Building a Reusable Game Engine - FAQ

**Unit 06: Optimization, Polish & Engine Abstractions | Topic 03 | Frequently Asked Questions**

---

## Q1: Should I build my own engine?

**Answer:** **For learning, yes.** For production, maybe.

**Build your own when:**
- Learning game development
- Specific requirements
- Full control needed
- Educational project

**Use existing when:**
- Time-constrained
- Commercial project
- Need community support
- Mature features required

---

## Q2: How do I make my engine extensible?

**Answer:** **Use plugin architecture and events.**

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  install(engine: Engine): void;
}

class Engine {
  use(plugin: Plugin): void {
    plugin.install(this);
  }
}
```

---

## Q3: What should be in core vs plugins?

**Answer:** **Core: essential features. Plugins: optional features.**

**Core:**
- Rendering
- Input
- Asset loading
- Scene management
- Entity-Component

**Plugins:**
- Advanced physics
- Networking
- Particle effects
- Level editor

---

## Q4: How do I version my engine?

**Answer:** **Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer).**

- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes

Example: 1.2.3
- 1 = major version
- 2 = minor version
- 3 = patch version

---

## Q5: Should I support both Canvas and WebGL?

**Answer:** **Start with Canvas.** Add WebGL later if needed.

Canvas is:
- Simpler
- Sufficient for 2D
- Better browser support

WebGL for:
- Complex effects
- Thousands of sprites
- 3D graphics

---

## Q6: How do I document my engine?

**Answer:** **README, API docs, examples, tutorials.**

**Must have:**
- Installation instructions
- Quick start example
- API reference
- Migration guides

**Nice to have:**
- Video tutorials
- Interactive demos
- Discord community

---

## Q7: Should I write tests?

**Answer:** **Yes, at least for core systems.**

Test:
- Math utilities
- Collision detection
- Asset loading
- Component system

Use Jest or Vitest for TypeScript.

---

## Q8: How do I handle different screen sizes?

**Answer:** **Provide scaling options.**

```typescript
interface EngineConfig {
  scaleMode?: 'fit' | 'fill' | 'stretch' | 'none';
}
```

---

## Q9: Can I monetize my engine?

**Answer:** **Yes, choose appropriate license.**

**Options:**
- MIT: Free, permissive
- GPL: Open source, viral
- Commercial: Paid license
- Dual: Free for non-commercial

---

## Q10: How do I get users for my engine?

**Answer:** **Build great examples and promote.**

**Steps:**
1. Build impressive demo games
2. Write blog posts
3. Share on Reddit, Twitter
4. Create video tutorials
5. Answer questions on forums
6. Contribute to community

## Summary

### Engine Development Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer
2. **Document everything** - Good docs = adoption
3. **Provide examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Listen to users** - Feedback is gold
5. **Keep it focused** - Do one thing well
6. **Test thoroughly** - Bugs hurt reputation
7. **Version properly** - SemVer for clarity
8. **Support community** - Answer questions
9. **Iterate quickly** - Release often
10. **Have fun** - You're creating something amazing!
