## Testing Checklist

For each exercise, verify:

- [ ] Runs smoothly at 60 FPS
- [ ] Still works correctly when throttled to 30 FPS
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Clean code with types
- [ ] Comments explaining logic
- [ ] Delta time used correctly (in seconds)
- [ ] No magic numbers (use named constants)

---

## Performance Testing

Test your exercises under different conditions:

**Normal:**
- No throttling, should run at 60 FPS

**Slow CPU:**
- Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí CPU throttling 4√ó
- Should still maintain correct speed (lower FPS okay)

**Background Tab:**
- Switch to another tab
- Come back, should resume correctly

**Long Tab:**
- Leave tab open for 5+ minutes
- Should still work (no timer overflow)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using milliseconds instead of seconds:**
   ```typescript
   // WRONG
   x += speed * deltaMs  // deltaMs = 16.67
   
   // RIGHT
   x += speed * deltaSec  // deltaSec = 0.01667
   ```

2. **Not clamping delta time:**
   ```typescript
   // WRONG
   const delta = (now - last) / 1000
   
   // RIGHT
   const delta = Math.min((now - last) / 1000, 0.1)
   ```

3. **Accumulating time while paused:**
   ```typescript
   // WRONG
   deltaTime = (now - last) / 1000
   if (!paused) update(deltaTime)
   
   // RIGHT
   if (!paused) {
       deltaTime = (now - last) / 1000
       update(deltaTime)
   }
   last = now
   ```

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Get basic loop working first
2. **Test Frequently:** Throttle CPU often
3. **Use Console:** Log values to understand delta time
4. **Compare:** Run frame-dependent vs frame-independent side by side
5. **Measure:** Use performance.now() to profile bottlenecks
6. **Visualize:** Graph makes patterns obvious
