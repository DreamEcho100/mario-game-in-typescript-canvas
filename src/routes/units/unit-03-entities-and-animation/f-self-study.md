### Day 12-13: Advanced Patterns
**Goal:** Factory and component patterns

**Study:**
- Read `03-entity-management/a-lesson.md` (sections 5, 7)
- Review component system

**Practice:**
- Exercise 6: Entity factory
- Exercise 9: Component system

**Project:**
```typescript
// Level loader
- Define level in JSON
- Use factory to create entities
- Build entities with components
- Save/load level data
```

**Example JSON:**
```json
[
  { "type": "player", "x": 50, "y": 400 },
  { "type": "enemy", "x": 200, "y": 400, "properties": { "health": 10 } },
  { "type": "coin", "x": 300, "y": 300 }
]
```

**Check Understanding:**
- [ ] Factory creates from data
- [ ] Components are flexible
- [ ] Can compose complex entities
- [ ] JSON loads correctly
- [ ] Easy to add new entity types
